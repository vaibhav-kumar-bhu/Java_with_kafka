This is the spring boot application where i created two microservices basically that create a pub/sub model of the kafka .
Here i assume that delivery boy is going to deliver some food while moving enduser who ordered that food need to keep track like where their order actually reached .
So that this two microservices deliveryboy and enduser i have created one delivery boy will publish their location and enduser/endusers will see by subscribing .
This is the basic app for the demonstration purpose .
